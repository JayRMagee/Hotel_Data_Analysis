# Hotel_Data_Analysis
In this project I analyzed hotel data to uncover certain facts about the hotel. I imported the data to SQL to get a quick understanding of the data. I created a CTE so that  I would be able to select from a specific collection of select statements and then join on the information that I cared about. I then brought my data over to PowerBI and included the sql code that I created and made a simple interactive dashboard that displayed my discoveries. I was able to show the increase in revenue over the years, as well as the specific hotels locations that had a impact. I was also able to uncover the small percentage of residents that use the parking space.
